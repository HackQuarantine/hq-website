# Submission Information

For people who do want to submit for prizes, you can do so on [Devpost](https://hackquarantine.devpost.com) at [hackquarantine.devpost.com](https://hackquarantine.devpost.com/)!

Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkuU6DjAqeQ) explaining how to submit a project to [Devpost](https://hackquarantine.devpost.com).

Try and include as much detail as possible, as this will help our judges understand your project! Include photos and other resources that will help us. We won't have time to download them and run them so **pictures** that show them working will help show off your project. If it's difficult to demo your project, try and simulate it or show what it could achieve if used in the correct environment. 

### Judging Criteria

This will be the criteria that we will be using when we're going through the projects. Try and write about each one of these points in your [Devpost](https://hackquarantine.devpost.com) submission!

#### Contribution 

How well does it solve the problem, how much would it impact.

#### Completion

How close to completion is it? Proof of concept/prototype/actually live.

#### Design, UI and UX

How easy is it for people to use.

#### Technology 

How well are tools and technologies being used.

#### Originality

How original is your project, is it a unique problem that it solves.


### Video Submission

If you're interested in making a video for Demofest on our live stream, send us your video [here](/submissions)!

We want to see your project working, so take a recording on your phone, or a screen recording of it in action! 

We won't be showing demos on our live stream that are PowerPoint presentations.
